🖥️ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program — VSD

This repository captures my structured learning and weekly progress as part of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program organized by VLSI System Design (VSD).

📌 Program Overview

The program provides hands-on exposure to the end-to-end System-on-Chip (SoC) design flow, starting from RTL development and extending to GDSII generation using open-source EDA tools.
It is part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, enabling thousands of participants to contribute to silicon design and strengthen the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.

Learning Flow:
RTL ➝ Logic Synthesis ➝ Physical Design ➝ Tapeout

📅 Week 0 — Setup and Tool Installation

Objectives:

Establish the working environment for SoC design.

Install and validate open-source tools including Yosys, OpenLane, Magic, and others.

Understand the overall program scope and methodology.

Key Highlights:

Exposure to industry-relevant workflows for chip design.

Familiarization with the open-source EDA ecosystem.

Collaboration within a large-scale initiative (3500+ participants).

Contribution to the vision of advancing India’s semiconductor capabilities.

🙏 Acknowledgment

I extend my gratitude to Kunal Ghosh and the VSD team for leading this program and providing the opportunity to gain practical experience in SoC design and tapeout.
